TODO:
1. Download data
2. Plan of attack
    - metrics to plot
        - wind speed, wave height, air temp, water temp
    - weights for each metric

Data processing
- filter
    - keep data points from 10AM to 6PM
        - only want to go boating when the sun is up
    - data from June to August

Plot data
- show filtered data
- MAC data values and weights to generate score for each day

Draw backs:
- by added more data a better decision could be made
    - UV index
    - boat traffic
    - cload coverage
    - percipitaion
